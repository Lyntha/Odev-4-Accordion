          <p>2B, supported by 9S, is sent to the Factory to
            eliminate their target. After making her way through the facility and being attacked several times by
            Goliath wheels, 2B makes her way out of the facility without having found her target. 9S informs her that
            there is another facility across the bridge, but that it's unusual for command to get the location of a
            target wrong. 2B then tells him that they weren't wrong, as she is attacked by Goliath.
          </p>
          <p>A fight ensues, leading to 9S joining the fight, only to be slammed off his flight unit by Goliath. When
            Goliath is down, 2B makes her way to the top of him to find a mortally wounded 9S. He implores 2B to leave
            him
            to finish the mission and destroy the target. 2B hesitantly complies and takes his flight unit to defeat
            Goliath. After the target is destroyed, 2B and 9S reunite, only for three more Goliaths to appear and attack
            them. 2B and 9S are forced to detonate their black boxes in order to destroy the Goliaths, but their fates
            are
            left unknown.

          <p>The events of the 14th Machine War unfold through three main characters' perspectives, 2B, 9S, and A2, all
            of
            whom fight as the last remnants of human civilization against otherworldly invaders. The battle is not so
            black-and-white, however, as the androids begin to question their own motives and the world in which they
            inhabit whilst being thrown into difficult situations and moral dilemmas.
